## About me

I am a senior researcher at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning ([AIML](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/)) at the University of Adelaide where I am a part of the [Sentient Satellites Lab](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ssl/).

 Previously, I was associate with the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision ([ACRV](https://roboticvision.org/)).

I am intersted in robots and space.

The full list of publications I have been involved in can be found in the [publication](/publications) section.
