title: "SLAM in the era of deep Learning"
subtitle: Proposed ICRA 2019 Workshop
---


Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) is one of the fundamental challenges in mobile robotics. Reconstruction and tracking has been considered purely geometric problems for decades with occasional assistance from perception techniques like object detection/segmentation or relocalization. However, in recent past, end-to-end deep learning methods have not only produced great results for perception tasks such a single-view depth estimation and semantic segmentation, their use in multiview/stereo reconstruction and ego-motion estimation have produced remarkably good results as well.

This workshop aims to look the at the intersection of SLAM and deep learning. Deep learning inspired solutions to robust SLAM ranges from adaptation of traditional SLAM pipelines to incorporate learnable priors, robust patch based features for matching to end-to-end learnable systems. Both supervised and unsupervised learning solutions to single view depth estimation, stereo-reconstruction, egomotion estimation are proposed in the recent past with near state of art performance and a great interest has been shown by the community to extend and adapt this solutions for a scalable SLAM system. The recent success of the end to end learning methods in context of SLAM poses an interesting open question: To what extent SLAM can be posed as a pure machine learning problem? 

This workshop will debate if an end-to-end learnable large scale SLAM solution is realistic. We aim to discuss which components of our existing traditional SLAM frameworks are essential for robustness and accuracy and where actually a learning based solution is more germain. A fair comparison of the traditional and learning based approach is essential to answer these questions. Thus, the workshop also aims to discuss scaling learning based SLAM pipelines and rethink the datasets and evaluation techniques of robust SLAM systems in light of deep learning requiring large datasets. 

The topics of interest includes but are not limited to:

- Deep learning for single/two/multiview SFM
- Learnable drop-in replacements for existing components of large scale SLAM frameworks
- Efficient static and dynamic scene representations suitable for deep learning
- Evaluation methodologies and datasets for comparing learning based and traditional robust SLAM solutions
- Integrating semantics with SLAM
- Learning image based scene priors
- Learning-based methods for place recognition under challenging conditions
- Utilizing deep learning methods to adapt current SLAM methods for lifelong operation
