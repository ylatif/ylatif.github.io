 |Thursday 04/10/2018 | 2-3pm 5.57 |"DeepTAM: deep tracking and mapping", [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01900.pdf)|  *Ravi Garg*|
 
   


 The idea is to meet every week / fortnight and discuss the papers which are relevant to most of us working on Semantic SLAM. 
 Although the general theme we envision at the moment is same as semantic slam special interest group, the non exhustive list of possible topics to formulate the agenda is:


- Developments in traditional Structure from Motion and SLAM.
    - Old and new SLAM pipelines, dense/sparse SLAM, backend as well as front end related papers
    - Modelling static and dynamic scenes, scalable, flexible and efficient representations for SLAM
    - Optimization for SLAM (pose graph, BA, filtering etc.)
    - Optimization on CRFs  / robust model fitting  / outlier detection
    - Localization and loop closure in SLAM
    - Using semantics into SLAM (incorporating planes, quadrics or more rich object representation for better tracking and/or mapping)
    - Uncertainties in SLAM and data fusion

- Learning and SLAM
    - Single/Multiview depth/normal estimation
    - Object shape and pose learning
    - Object Detection, Semantic/Instance Segmentation (including traditional inference methods graph cuts, model fitting etc.)
    - Egomotion estimation, tracking object instances (rigid/articulated/deformable)
    - Novel pipelines to integrate deep learning effectively with SLAM
    - Enforcing multiview consistency on single view predictions (video understanding)
    - Robust localization, mapping and segmentation under weather changes
    - New architectures and loss functions and training techniques of NNs which related to SLAM
    - Techniques for sharper dense predictions in general
    - Sequential predictions with or without RNNs
    - Generative models and inference with them for SLAM and semantics 
    - Unsupervised/Self-Supervised/Semi-Supervised Learning
    - Uncertainty estimation and data fusion with deep-nets
 

Please don't hesitate to propose other topics (via email to Ravi / Yasir) which you think might be beneficial in this list or to invite other people interested in participating.
If you want to discuss a particular paper and lead the reading group please feel free to contact Yasir or Ravi.
